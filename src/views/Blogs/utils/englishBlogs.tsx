Airlines often release unsold seats at a discount close to the departure date, so if your schedule allows, take advantage of these opportunities. \n Is it better to book a flight or hotel first? \n Well, The decision depends on individual circumstances. If flexible travel dates are crucial, securing a favorable flight might be a priority.

              The world’s biggest tomato battle, La Tomatina, is the funniest fight ever. There are
              plenty of theories about how it came about, but no one knows for sure. The original
              story came from a carnival in 1945 where there was a brawl in the city’s central
              plaza, where tomatoes from a local vegetable stand were used as weapons.
